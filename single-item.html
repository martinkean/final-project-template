            <h3 class="single-item__h3">The bestselling science fiction novel of all time.</h3>

            <p class="single-item__introduction">Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank
                Herbert, originally published as two separate serial. Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal
                interstellar society, descended from terrestrial humans, in which various noble houses control planetary
                fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet
                Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only
                source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also
                necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that
                only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted
                and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion,
                ecology, technology, and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle
                for the control of Arrakis and its spice.</p>

                <p class="single-item__p">Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by
                    some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written. The novel has been translated into
                    dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies. Dune has been regularly cited as one of
                    the world's best-selling science fiction novels.</p>
                <ul class="single-item__ul">
                    <li><em>Dune</em> tied with <b>Roger</b> Zelazny's <em>This Immortal</em> for the Hugo Award in 1966
                        and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.</li>
                    <li><b>Arthur C. Clarke</b> described <em>Dune</em> as "unique" and wrote, "I know nothing
                        comparable to it except <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</li>
                    <li>After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, <b>Carl Sagan</b> in 1978 listed <em>Dune</em> as
                        among stories "that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an
                        unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical".</li>
                    <li>On November 5, 2019, the <em>BBC News</em> listed <em>Dune</em> on its list of the <b>100 most
                            influential novels</b>.</li>
